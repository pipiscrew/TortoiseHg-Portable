# TortoiseHg-Portable
Plain installer, no services, no folder icons, only shell context menu... 
It could be portable but for the easiness, made installer.. 

Supported systems : x86, x64

VC+ 2008 Runtimes required.


If shell context menu doesnt appear, restart is helpful...

ps check ***+how_to*** ***+portable*** folders into program folder
